# NatureBot! Upload photos of the world around you

Upload photos of the world around you to multiple social media platforms simultaneously. A photo, a description, some optional hashtags, and you're sharing wonderful photos of things like your dog on a walk, a really cool bird, a flower that's just starting to bloom. NatureBot, sharing the beauty of nature with the internet since 2023.

Each module is responsible for the handling and submission of data to the target platform. facebook.py goes to facebook, and so on. 

running main.py will activate the program. the program will expect a picture file and a body of text containing anywhere from 5 to 500 characters. The user will then be asked to submit some strings as hashtags for the submission of their post. This step is optional. 

Once the pictures have been submitted, they are moved into the "submissions" folder so users can see what they submitted and when it was submitted.
