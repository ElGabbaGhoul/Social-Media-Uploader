Project NatureBot Created
    - created idea for The Project. Input a picture of Nature. Woods, trees, flowers, animals, etc etc., along with a description of the picture, some hashtags, and then send that out to all linked social media platforms. At this time, the desired platforms are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn. 
    - Found out that Instagram's API is no longer very good, or even possible to work with. 
    - Decided I should make a new Facebook account for project NatureBot.

    - began implementing facebook api communication to allow content to post.
    - decided CrossPost is a better name for this app, as it doesn't limit user to one kind of image. 
    - did a lot of work on things besides facebook on facebook branch
    - added facebook (and twitter) post submission functionality
    - added credentials.py which saves hashed passwords. allegedly. 

    - FOR TOMORROW: I am going to have credentials be the module that asks what platform the user wants to post to. then the request for credentials will come from the respective module. Currently, credentials asks, as does the Social Media Platform Module (SMPP). Keep up the good work scooter C:
