Project NatureBot Created
    - created idea for The Project. Input a picture of Nature. Woods, trees, flowers, animals, etc etc., along with a description of the picture, some hashtags, and then send that out to all linked social media platforms. At this time, the desired platforms are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn. 
    - Found out that Instagram's API is no longer very good, or even possible to work with. 
    - Decided I should make a new Facebook account for project NatureBot.
